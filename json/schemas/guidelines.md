The json schema specifies how a json file should be build. For the json schema format see here: http://json-schema.org/ and some introduction here: https://spacetelescope.github.io/understanding-json-schema/index.html 
Schema's were derived using an online editor (http://jsonschema.net/#/) based on json file structures that were in turn based on the original Perl hash structures.
Use this tool: http://json-schema-faker.js.org/ to generate random json based on that schema.
